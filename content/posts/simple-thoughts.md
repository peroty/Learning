If I were to write my thoughts tonight. About Hugo and finally (maybe) getting it to work. I'm pretty excited actually. It seems as it I've gotten the process down and it's repeatable and I'm learning it.

I can start putting those piles of .md files into something prettier and easier to deal with than being lost to the sands of time.
