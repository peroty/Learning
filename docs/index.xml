      <description>The Millennial Urban Lifestyle Is About to Get More Expensive  I don’t know if it makes sense, and I don’t know how long it’s going to last. Is there a better epitaph for this age of consumer technology?

      <description>After upgrading my Ubuntu desktop box from 18.04 to 20.x, after the reboot, the startup process hung trying to mount an NFS share.
a start job is running for /mnt/location
To resolve this, I had to boot into recovery mode.
Hold left shift at startup
Then edit the fstab file
nano /etc/fstab
And removed the NFS shares I was mounting on startup.
I learned this is what the noauto option is for when mounting a share.</description>
