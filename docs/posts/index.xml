      <description>After upgrading my Ubuntu desktop box from 18.04 to 20.x, after the reboot, the startup process hung trying to mount an NFS share.
a start job is running for /mnt/location
To resolve this, I had to boot into recovery mode.
Hold left shift at startup
Then edit the fstab file
nano /etc/fstab
And removed the NFS shares I was mounting on startup.
I learned this is what the noauto option is for when mounting a share.</description>

      <description>The Millennial Urban Lifestyle Is About to Get More Expensive  I don’t know if it makes sense, and I don’t know how long it’s going to last. Is there a better epitaph for this age of consumer technology?

      <description>If I were to write my thoughts tonight. About Hugo and finally (maybe) getting it to work. I&#39;m pretty excited actually. It seems as it I&#39;ve gotten the process down and it&#39;s repeatable and I&#39;m learning it.
I can start putting those piles of .md files into something prettier and easier to deal with than being lost to the sands of time.</description>
